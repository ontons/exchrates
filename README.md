# exchrates
Test assesment for a job interview

### Features
* Accepts two command line arguments:
    * To run the server: `exchrates server`
    * To fetch data: `exchrates fetch`
* Configuration is stored in environment variables (example provided in `example.env` file).
* By default, the server runs on port `:8080`.
* Provides two endpoints:
    * `/latest`
    * `/history?currency=usd`
* Logs are stored in the `/logs` folder.
* Docker volumes are stored in the `/volumes` folder.

### Run in Docker
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ontons/exchrates.git`
2. Navigate to the newly created folder: `cd exchrates`
3. Create a `.env` file in the repository root folder (copy from `example.env` and modify if needed): `cp example.env .env`
4. Build and run the containers: `sudo docker compose up -d --build`
5. Fetch the latest rates: `sudo docker compose exec app /app/exchrates fetch`
6. Access the application:
    * `http://localhost:8080/latest`
    * `http://localhost:8080/history?currency=usd`
7. Stop the containers: `sudo docker compose stop`
8. Remove the containers and volumes: `sudo docker compose down -v`

### Run in VSCode
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ontons/exchrates.git`
2. Create a `.env` file in the root folder (copy from `example.env`).
3. Start the database container: `sudo docker compose start mariadb`
4. Navigate to the `/app` folder.
5. Install dependencies: `go mod tidy`
6. Run and debug using one of the VSCode launch configurations for the server or fetch command.

<summary><h3>ðŸš€ Highlighted Skills</h3></summary>

#### Go Backend Development
* Implemented a full microservice backend in Go.
* Utilized idiomatic Go features such as interfaces, channels, goroutines, errgroup, etc.

#### Custom Logging & Error Handling
* Designed a custom logger with:
    * Multiple writers (stdout, file).
    * Log levels (Info, Warn, Error, Fatal).
    * Error wrapping with stack traces in debug mode.
    * Proper error context handling (`ErrorWithContext`) for easier debugging.

#### Configuration Management
* Implemented a thread-safe configuration package using `sync.RWMutex`.
* Features include:
    * Environment variable loading (supports loading all variables or selective loading with defaults).
    * Type-safe accessors (`GetString`, `GetInt`, `GetBool`, `GetFloat`).
    * Default values for missing environment variables.
    * Error-returning getters to prevent runtime panics, avoiding silent type casts.
* Ensures configuration remains decoupled and reusable across services and packages.

#### Dependency Injection (DI) & Decoupling
* Used constructor-based DI (`NewRateService`) to pass dependencies.
* Separated concerns: provider, store, service, logger.
* Services depend on abstractions (interfaces), not implementations.

#### Concurrency & Parallelism
* Implemented concurrent fetching of rates with goroutines and channels.
* Used `errgroup.Group` to manage goroutines and collect errors safely.
* Applied channel buffering to optimize parallel rate fetching.

#### Database Integration
* Implemented a `store` package wrapping `*sql.DB` for clean and reusable persistence logic.
* Automatic migrations:
    * Creates the `rates` table if it does not exist.
* Transactional inserts:
    * Ensures consistency when saving multiple currency rates.
* Efficient queries:
    * `GetLatest()` fetches the most recent rates per currency.
    * `GetHistory(currency)` retrieves full historical data ordered by date.
* Dynamically built connection strings from configuration and ensured proper resource cleanup using `defer db.Close()`.
* Integrated seamlessly with a MariaDB container using Docker Compose.

#### Microservice Patterns
* Command-based execution (`server`, `fetch`).
* HTTP server with handlers for REST endpoints (e.g., `GetHistory`).
* Graceful error handling and consistent API responses.

#### Containerization & Orchestration
* Used Docker Compose for local development and service orchestration:
    * Defined services for MariaDB and the application.
    * Configured persistent volumes for database and logs.
    * Added container health checks for reliable startup.
    * Passed environment variables for configurable runtime setup.

#### Clean Architecture Principles
* Domain services (`RateService`) are separated from transport (`Handler`) and infrastructure (`store`, `provider`).
* Encourages maintainability and testability.
